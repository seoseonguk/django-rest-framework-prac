For http test server. This is only if you need to test a raw HTML
index file as a test server. The goal here is to install the node
& javascript package manager to get the package "http-server" in
order to emmulate a server so ajax requests work in a local
testing environment.


Quick way for all: https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm

2. Install Node.js and the Javascript Package Manager (npm) via homebrew:
-> sudo brew install npm
*note: need computer admin rights for "sudo"
3. Install "http-server" via npm.
